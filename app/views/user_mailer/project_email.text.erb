Hi <%= @user.name.split(" ")[0] %>,

You are required to put together a full list of all the members in <%= @user.church_groups.where.not(id: 10).first.name %>. 

This should be done by filling out the 'Add New Member' form, which you'll find a link to on your Revelations home page. The required information will be their name, which campus church they belong to and whether you have personally visited them.

Deadline for completion is Monday 27th February 2017.

You can respond directly to this email with any technical queries.

 Thanks!
